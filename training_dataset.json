    "question": "DataSentinel Inc. is a tech company specializing in building advanced natural language processing (NLP) solutions. Their latest project involves integrating an AI-powered sentiment analysis module into an internal monitoring dashboard. The goal is to automatically classify large volumes of unstructured feedback and text data from various sources as either GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. As part of the quality assurance process, the development team needs to test the integration with a series of sample inputs—even ones that may not represent coherent text—to ensure that the system routes and processes the data correctly.\n\nBefore rolling out the live system, the team creates a test harness using Python. The harness employs the httpx library to send POST requests to OpenAI's API. For this proof-of-concept, the team uses the dummy model gpt-4o-mini along with a dummy API key in the Authorization header to simulate real API calls.\n\nOne of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:\n\nZW qVd V Ae f  bW5   IiP g   LeQ XqWGyoNJfLc gra\nWrite a Python program that uses httpx to send a POST request to OpenAI's API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:\n\nMake sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.\nUse gpt-4o-mini as the model.\nThe first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.\nThe second message must be exactly the text contained above.\nThis test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.\n\nNote: This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one. You can only use:\n\nresponse = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)\nresponse = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)\nresponse.raise_for_status()\nresponse.json()\nCode",

    "question": "Acme Global Solutions manages hundreds of invoices from vendors every month. To streamline their accounts payable process, the company is developing an automated document processing system. This system uses a computer vision model to extract useful text from scanned invoice images. Critical pieces of data such as vendor email addresses, invoice or transaction numbers, and other details are embedded within these documents.\n\nYour team is tasked with integrating OpenAI's vision model into the invoice processing workflow. The chosen model, gpt-4o-mini, is capable of analyzing both text and image inputs simultaneously. When an invoice is received—for example, an invoice image may contain a vendor email like alice.brown@acmeglobal.com and a transaction number such as 34921. The system needs to extract all embedded text to automatically populate the vendor management system.\n\nThe automated process will send a POST request to OpenAI's API with two inputs in a single user message:\n\nText: A simple instruction \"Extract text from this image.\"\nImage URL: A base64 URL representing the invoice image that might include the email and the transaction number among other details.\nHere is an example invoice image:\n\n\n\nWrite just the JSON body (not the URL, nor headers) for the POST request that sends these two pieces of content (text and image URL) to the OpenAI API endpoint.\n\nUse gpt-4o-mini as the model.\nSend a single user message to the model that has a text and an image_url content (in that order).\nThe text content should be Extract text from this image.\nSend the image_url as a base64 URL of the image above.

    "question": "SecurePay, a leading fintech startup, has implemented an innovative feature to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real time. As part of its security suite, the system analyzes personalized transaction messages by converting them into embeddings. These embeddings are compared against known patterns of legitimate and fraudulent messages to flag unusual activity.\n\nImagine you are working on the SecurePay team as a junior developer tasked with integrating the text embeddings feature into the fraud detection module. When a user initiates a transaction, the system sends a personalized verification message to the user's registered email address. This message includes the user's email address and a unique transaction code (a randomly generated number). Here are 2 verification messages:\n\nDear user, please verify your transaction code 36352 sent to 24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\nDear user, please verify your transaction code 61536 sent to 24f2006438@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\nThe goal is to capture this message, convert it into a meaningful embedding using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, and subsequently use the embedding in a machine learning model to detect anomalies.\n\nYour task is to write the JSON body for a POST request that will be sent to the OpenAI API endpoint to obtain the text embedding for the 2 given personalized transaction verification messages above.

    "question": "ShopSmart is an online retail platform that places a high value on customer feedback. Each month, the company receives hundreds of comments from shoppers regarding product quality, delivery speed, customer service, and more. To automatically understand and cluster this feedback, ShopSmart's data science team uses text embeddings to capture the semantic meaning behind each comment.\n\nAs part of a pilot project, ShopSmart has curated a collection of 25 feedback phrases that represent a variety of customer sentiments. Examples of these phrases include comments like “Fast shipping and great service,” “Product quality could be improved,” “Excellent packaging,” and so on. Due to limited processing capacity during initial testing, you have been tasked with determine which pair(s) of 5 of these phrases are most similar to each other. This similarity analysis will help in grouping similar feedback to enhance the company’s understanding of recurring customer issues.\n\nShopSmart has written a Python program that has the 5 phrases and their embeddings as an array of floats.

    "question": "InfoCore Solutions is a technology consulting firm that maintains an extensive internal knowledge base of technical documents, project reports, and case studies. Employees frequently search through these documents to answer client questions quickly or gain insights for ongoing projects. However, due to the sheer volume of documentation, traditional keyword-based search often returns too many irrelevant results.\n\nTo address this issue, InfoCore's data science team decides to integrate a semantic search feature into their internal portal. This feature uses text embeddings to capture the contextual meaning of both the documents and the user's query. The documents are pre-embedded, and when an employee submits a search query, the system computes the similarity between the query's embedding and those of the documents. The API then returns a ranked list of document identifiers based on similarity.\n\nImagine you are an engineer on the InfoCore team. Your task is to build a FastAPI POST endpoint that accepts an array of docs and query string via a JSON body. The endpoint is structured as follows:\n\nPOST /similarity\n\n{\n  \"docs\": [\"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\", \"Contents of document 3\", ...],\n  \"query\": \"Your query string\"\n}\nService Flow:\n\nRequest Payload: The client sends a POST request with a JSON body containing:\ndocs: An array of document texts from the internal knowledge base.\nquery: A string representing the user's search query.\nEmbedding Generation: For each document in the docs array and for the query string, the API computes a text embedding using text-embedding-3-small.\nSimilarity Computation: The API then calculates the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each document embedding. This allows the service to determine which documents best match the intent of the query.\nResponse Structure: After ranking the documents by their similarity scores, the API returns the identifiers (or positions) of the three most similar documents. The JSON response might look like this:\n\n{\n  \"matches\": [\"Contents of document 3\", \"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\"]\n}\nHere, \"Contents of document 3\" is considered the closest match, followed by \"Contents of document 1\", then \"Contents of document 2\".\n\nMake sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers.\n\nWhat is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity",
